     ITEMS - [This option is the same for all crew members and it 
     will  only  appear here].  When this button  is  pressed,  6 
     options appear in the text window.  (See #2 in the  Starship 
     Message Window Layouts.) The options are USE,  PICKUP, DROP, 
     EXAMINE,  TRANSFER,  &  QUIT.  A highlighting cursor appears 
     over  the  word  USE (same as on  the  planet).  Moving  the 
     joystick up or down moves the cursor up or down.  It doesn't 
     wrap  around.  Moving the joystick left moves the cursor  to 
     QUIT.  Moving  it  left from QUIT puts the cursor  on  DROP. 
     Note:  Anytime  an action is aborted a message is  given  to 
     that effect.

     USE:  [For  EXAMINE  simply  replace  the  word  "USE"  with 
     "EXAMINE"]  When the use option is invoked the list of  crew 
     names  appear in the window with the message,  "Who will use 
     the item?" (Starship Message Window Layout #3) [Note:  there 
     is no CARGO option].

     A highlighted cursor appears over Name 1 & may be moved with 
     the joystick.  It does not wrap around. Quit aborts. After a 
     name  is  selected,   display  in  the  window,  "Possession     
     Cargo" with a cursor on Possession & the message "Where will 
     the item come from?" Move the cursor to select.

     If CARGO....
          Is  the hold empty?  If it is,  give the  message  "The 
          cargo hold is empty." Else, Display the cargo list. Use 
          layout  #5.  Use the cursor & scrolling list to select. 
          Quit aborts.

     If POSSESSION....

          Is the possession list empty?  If so, give the message, 
          "There  are no possessions to use." Else,  display  the 
          character's  possessions.  Use Starship Message  Window 
          Layout   #5.   Replace   "Cargo  Location"   with   the 
          Character's name and do NOT display % full.

          Use  cursor & scrolling list (with MORE indicators when 
          appropriate) to select item. Quit aborts.
       
     PICKUP :  Display the list of Crew Names & the message  "Who 
     will  pick up the item?" (Layout #3) [Note:  Do not  include 
     cargo in the options.] QUIT aborts the action.

     After a character is chosen:  Display the Cargo Hold Display 
     (layout  #4)  with  the message "Where will  the  item  come 
     from?"  (If  there are no cargo pods,  do not display the  -
     CARGO PODS- header). QUIT aborts the action.

     After choosing the Cargo Hold: Check to see if it is empty - 
     if so, give the message "This Cargo Hold is empty." Abort.
     Else,  list the contents of the hold (with layout #5).  Move 
     the cursor to select the item. Quit aborts.

     When  the  item  is selected,  check to see  if  it  can  be 
     carried.  If  not,  give the message "This crew member can't 
     carry that much." Else,  transfer the item to Crew  member's 
     possession list - END

     DROP  & TRANFER:  Display the list of crew members  [include 
     cargo]  (layout  #3) with the message "Where will  the  item 
     come from?". QUIT aborts. 

     If  "CARGO" is selected,  display the CARGO HOLDS ( layout # 
     4)  with  the message "Where will the item(s)  come  from?". 
     QUIT aborts.

     After a Hold is chosen,  or if a Crew Member had been chosen 
     - check to see if the list is empty. If so, give the message 
     "The  cargo hold is empty." or "There are  no  possessions." 
     Else, display the Cargo hold contents or the possession list 
     (layout #5) and choose item with the cursor.

     [DROP] -- Add "ALL" to the bottom of any list with more than 
               one item.  If dropping something from a possession 
               list  - it goes into the ship's cargo hold.  Check 
               to see if hold is full - if so give a message  and 
               abort. Else move item to ship's hold.

               If  dropping something from a cargo hold - it goes 
               into  deep  space.  Give message on  blank  window 
               "Permission to jettison this item,  Captain? <-- N  
               Y -->" 

               No  aborts,  yes  wipes the item  from  the  known 
               universe. <WUSHHHH!>

     [TRANSFER]  When  an  item is chosen  it  becomes  inverted. 
               Unlike any of the other operations, MULTIPLE items 
               may  be  transfered.  Selecting an inverted  item, 
               deselects it.  Add ALL to the bottom  of any  list 
               with  more than one item.  If QUIT is invoked, and 
               no items have been selected then abort transfer.If 
               ALL is invoked or if QUIT is invoked  and at least
               1 item has been selected then:
                
                   Display  the  crew list (layout  #3)  [Include 
                   cargo].  With  the  message  "Where  will  the 
                   item(s) go?".

                   Move  the  cursor  to  select  - Quit   aborts 
                   transfer.

                   If  cargo is selected,  display the cargo hold 
                   list (layout #4) and select destination.  Also 
                   give the message: "Where will the item(s) go?" 
                   QUIT aborts.

                   After  a  destination (either  Crew  or  Cargo 
                   Hold)  is selected,  check to see if there  is 
                   enough  room  and/or the character  can  carry 
                   that much.

                   If  not,  give a message to that effect at the 
                   bottom  and  abort,   otherwise  TRANSFER  the 
                   materials.

1. CAPTAIN:

     It  is not necessary to check whether or not there is a 
living captain as there always is one. (When the captain dies the 
next in command automatically becomes captain.  Chain of command: 
Captain, Sci.Off., Navig., Engin., Commun., Doctor). Note - for 
every crew position other than captain that is not assigned, when
the  button is pressed for that position give the message "YOU DO 
NOT HAVE A ______ , CAPTAIN".

  a. CREW  FILES - This button causes the crew files (records) to 
     appear  just as they do in PERSONNEL in Starport.  The  only 
     difference  is  that there is no heading at the top  of  the 
     file and no option box at the bottom of the screen. There is 
     a message in the text window  at the  bottom that says "Push 
     the  button to Return to Command Control." 

     Moving  the joystick forward or backward pages  through  the 
     files.  A  "whiff"  sound occurs when moving  between  files 
     (records).  ONLY  those files of the crew on board the  ship 
     are accessable.  The files do wrap around.  If the Character 
     is dead, his file has a DEAD stamp.
      
  b. ASSIGN CREW - This button causes crew assignment to occur in 
     the  text  window.  A highlighted cursor appears in line  2. 
     Within  this cursor is the Crew Position & the name  of  the 
     currently  assigned  crew  members (see #1 in  the  Starship 
     Message  Window  Layouts).   If  there  is  no  crew  member 
     currently assigned, the name slot (on the right) is occupied 
     by "unassigned".  In lines 4 & 5 give the message:  "Use the 
     joystick to change the name","Press the button to select."

     Moving the joystick  changes  the name in that  window.  The 
     names  do  wrap around.  The word "Unassigned" does not  re-
     appear  once  it has been changed.  ONLY  LIVING  characters 
     appear in the name window.

     Pressing  the  button causes the current name to  lock  into 
     that  crew  position <Ding> and the next  Crew  Position  to 
     appear.  After  the last one (doctor) is done,  the  message 
     appears:  "Crew  Assignment Completed.",  hold message for 2 
     seconds then <Dong> it's erased.

  c. LOG  PLANET - When this button is pressed check to see if  a 
     planet is currently being orbited.  If not, give the message 
     "<beep> You must be in orbit to log a planet.", hold message 
     for 2 seconds. If the ship is in orbit: check to see if this 
     planet has been logged before.  If it has, give the message: 
     "<beep> This planet has already been logged." If it  hasn't, 
     give  the message "Do you wish to recommend that this planet 
     be colonized?  <-- N  Y -->". If the response is "No", quit. 
     Else,  give  the message:  "How do you rate this planet  for 
     colonization?  (Number from 1 to 10.  1=Poor,  10=Perfect)". 
     Below this message is a highlighting cursor with the  number 
     1  in  it.  At the bottom is the message - "Use joystick  to 
     change  number.  Press  button  to  select."  Joystick  left 
     decreases the number,  right increases.  The numbers do  NOT 
     wrap around.  Pressing the button locks the number. Give the 
     message,  "Recommendation  Noted.  Now launching FTL  homing 
     drone..." (Pause 2 seconds) <FSSSHHHT!> "Launch completed."

  d. Ships Log - XXXXXXXX
 
  e. SAVE GAME - Give the message:  "Do you wish to save the game 
     and quit?  <-- N  Y -->". If the response is "No", quit this 
     option. Else, give the message,"Insert Master Disk and press 
     Return." Check to see if the Master Disk is present;  if not 
     give the previous message.  Else,  give the message, "Saving 
     Game...." followed by "....  Complete. Press Return to Exit" 
     when Return is pressed, exit to DOS.
                                                 
  f. Bridge -

2. SCIENCE OFFICER:
  
  a. STATUS - Check to see if the status display is up already,
     ( see status display layout ). If it is give the message:
     " You already have the status display, captain "; otherwise
     slam the status display into the auxillary screen and is a
     science officer option. For the layout see the prism file of 
     the aux screens. (Gregs.pic).
  
     Eight types of information are given in the status display:

                               1. date
                               2. food
                               3. damage
                               4. shields
                               5. weapons
                               6. hull temp
                               7. fuel
                               8. shield power

     1. Date:  The date is shown in the followin field. XXXX-XX-XX,
        and represents respectively the year, the month, and the 
        day. This is the internal game time that is incremented 
        continually from the onset of the game. Time is measured
        in G.S.A., General Standard Arth Time. The year is 10
        months long, the month is 30 days long, the day is 24 hrs
        long, an hour = 60 mins, and a minute = 60 secs.

     2. Food:  Food is shown in the number of food packs. Up to
        99,999 food packs may be represented. Food shown here is
        the sum total of all food packs aboard - this includes
        any cargo hold items of possessions. Food packs are used
        up at varying rates dependent on the consumption rates 
        of the crew members. The consumption rate is the amt of
        food packs consumed buy one character in 10 days.
 
     3. Damage:  Overall damage of the ship is given here. It is 
        given at a resolution of 4 categories. Overall damage
        is saved as a variable and is updated only when any
        damage is done to the ship or when any repairs are done.
        The 4 overall damage levels correspond to the text
        messages of: 0 = none
                     1 = light
                     2 = heavy
                     3 = critical
        There are 4 to 7 areas that a ship may take damage in
        ( this depends on whether of not the ship has shields,
        missles or lasers ). To re-compute overall damage, add
        up all the damage levels (0-100 where 0 = destroyed and 
        100 = undamaged) and divide by the no. of damageable      
        areas. If this # is = 100, then the damage level is
        none. If this # is from 60 to 99, then the damage level
        is 1 (light). If its from 1 to 59 then the damage level
        = 2 (heavy). If the damage to the hull is <21 the damage
        level is 3 (critical) - this overrides other damage levels.

     4. Shields: After "shields" is either the word "down" or     
        "up" for whether of not the shields are activated. Shields
        are raised and lowered by means of the navigator and this
        is done immediately when the button is pressed.

     5. Weapons:  Following "weapons", is one of 3 words; unarmed,
        arming or armed. The "arming" message flashes, the other 
        2 do not. A weapon stays armed until disarmed.   

     6. Hull Temp: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX

     7. Fuel: Fuel is shown on the fuel meter which registers up
        to 10,000 kilograms of Endurium. This is all the endurium
        on board, in holds or as possessions. Fuel is consumed at
        a rate of X kilograms per sector traveled in hyperspace  
        and Y kilograms per unit time of acceleration. This X &
        Y is constant for all ships. Fuel is not consumed while 
        in orbit. (for now say that X & Y both = 1 and time = 1
        second).

     8. Shield Power: Shield power is displayed for each of the 
        Y shields in bar graph form. Shield power is updated each
        time damage is taken, as well as once each second 
        when power is below the maximum. For an explanation of 
        what  shield power is and how it works see shields 
        section of navigator duties.

  b. SENSORS - Sensor readings may be taken by the science off-
        icer when on the tactical display or when in orbit around
        a planet or star. When attempting to get sensor readings
        in hyperspace the message is returned "the sensors are
        non-operational in hyperspace". When attempting to get 
        sensor readings at the system level the message is return-
        ed "sensors are not picking up anything". When at the 
        tactical level a cursor appears on the screen; the empty
        sensor template comes up in the aux window. A message
        reads "target sensors with Joystick and begin scanning
        with button". When in orbit the cursor appears in the 
        center of the screen. The message reads "begin scanning
        with button". In tactical the joystick moves the cursor
        around. In either tactical or orbit when the button is
        pressed, flash the word "scanning" in the message window in
        medium font for a few seconds. While the sensors are scan-
        ning life and energy readings are shown as flashing dots
        within the object's outline. Once scanning has ceased these
        dots freeze and cease flashing. The sensor display stays
        in the aux screen with the information until it is replaced.
        While scanning, fill in the template with sensor data and
        put composition in the text window. Sensory data includes:

             Mass - quanity with units of measurement
             Temperature
             Composition
             Object Profile
             Life Readings
             Energy Readings
        
        STARS -
          Mass: is given as a no. from 0.1 to 50 randomly gener-
          ated using the location values of the star as the random 
          no. seed. To determine the mass of a star, roll a random
          no. from -45 to +45 (normal distribution). If its 0 then
          set = 1. If the no. is negitive then divide 45 by it and
          subtract it from 10. (ie. 10-45/X). Display it in decimal
          notation. If the no. is positive use it as is.
          Units: used are O.S.M.'s (old sol mass).
          
          Temperature: Compute a random no. N using the location
          seed from 0 to 10. Find the temp for the appropriate 
          spectral class from the table. Add N% to that no. Its   
          given in degrees C.

                   M - 3200         K - 4000

                   O - 30000

          Composition: All stars have a composition of hydrogen
          and helium gas.

          Object Profile: If the mass is <6 use a small circle.
                          If >5 & <20 use a medium circle.
                          If >19 use a big circle.
        
          Life Readings: Life readings is a no. from 0 to 100.
          All stars have a life reading of 0.

          Energy Reading: Energy readings are nos. from 0 to 100.
          All stars have an energy reading of 100.

        PLANETS -  
            Mass: A random no. from .01 to the max, where the max 
            is taken from a table and is dependent on the orbit #.

                            Planet mass table;

            If the no. is positive use it as is. If its from 0 to
            -8, add 9 and lead it with a decimal point ".". If its
            from -9 to -17 add 18 and lead it with a decimal and a
            0, ".0".
            Mass Units: are in "Old Earth Mass" units. (O.E.M.)
            
            Temperature: Two temps are given, the max and the min
            and these are taken from the planet's data base. They
            are resultant from modifications of the effective temp.
            For that orbit position based on atmosphere and some
            random deviation (to simulate spin). Temp may range
            from -273 `C to 3156 'C.

        Life Readings: Take the planetary bio-density (0-250) 
        from the data base. If it is >0 then multiply by 10 and
        divide by 25. This is the Life Reading.

        Energy Reading: for every planet a no. between 0 - 7
        will be in the data base. If the no. is 0 this means
        there are no sentients living on the planet above a 
        tech level 3. If there are sentients of level 4 or 
        greater, this no. represents the amt of energy they 
        give off as a function of their no. and tech level. For
        an energy reading multiply this no. by 10.



  c. ANALYSIS - A Science Officer may make an analysis of a sensor 
     reading if it is currently in the aux window and the view  
     screen context has not changed. If no sensor reading was
     taken, or the context has changed from (tactical to system 
     for example) the message is given "I require a sensor read-
     ing fo analyze, Captain". Sensor Readings may be taken at
     the tactical level from orbit only, not at the system
     level or in hyperspace. When an analysis is given a list of
     headers is also given. For each header there is a chance that
     the Science Officer will give some information. That % chance
     is = the Science Officer's skill / 2. If the Science Officer
     is unsuccessful the word "unknown" appears after the header.
     Each time a sensor reading is taken a random no. from 1 to
     64,000 is generated. This is done only for planets and stars.
     This no. is saved as a variable. When an analysis is required
     the new random no. is checked against the old random no. If
     they are the same the message is returned "I have already
     attempted analysis of this data, Captain". The variable is
     automatically wiped clean after 5 minutes. (Alien ships 
     may be read and analyzed as often as desired). Each time an
     analysis is made the Science Officer recieves his learning
     rate * 1 in internal skill points (1 - 25,000, see skills
     document). The first header given is always "analysis:".
     Following this is the objects class - this is given re-
     gardless of the Sci Off skill. The possible classis are:

                              Star
                              Planet

                              Mechanical
     
     For each class different headers are given. They include -

          STAR -  1). Spectral class: After this the letter M,K,
                      G,F,A,B, or O is given.

      DEBRIS - Nothing

3. NAVIGATOR:
      a. Raise/Lower Shields: If there are no shields when this
         button is pressed, give the message "WE DO NOT HAVE 
         SHIELDS, CAPTAIN". When the shields are down this option
         reads "RAISE SHIELDS". When they're up it reads "LOWER
         SHIELDS". "RAISE SHIELDS" - When this button is pressed 
         the shields are raised immediately. Change condition to
         "SHIELDS RAISED". If the status display is up change the 
         ship icon color from blue to grey and the word down to 
         up (after shields:). NOTE - The shield power displayed 
         in the bar graph around the icon are always displayed 
         reguardless of whether of not the shields are up. When 
         shields are off they drain no energy from the ship. When
         they are turned on they come on immediately. Energy is 
         drained  at a constant rate reguardless of whether or 
         not the ship is hit with weapons. The rate of energy 
         drainage = 5 per sec. Shield power is displayed in the 
         bar graphs on the status display and works as follows.
         Shields have a class (0-5), if 0 then there are no 
         shields. Delta?? damage = (0-100) and delta power for 
         front, left, right and rear. When a ship is hit with a 
         weapon and its shields are up the shield on the side hit 
         absorbs the damage. This reduces the power of the shield 
         by some amount. ( see weapons doc. for details ) This 
         amt is based on the weapon damage and the "current 
         shield class". As long as there is some power left in 
         the shield the ship takes no damage. When the power 
         level reaches 0 the shield no longer protects the ship.
         "Current shield class" is shield class as it is affected 
         by damage. "Current shield class" = (shield class) -
         (6 - ((damage + 19) / 20). "Current shield class" can 
         not be < 0. Shield power is measured for each side 
         shield from 0 to 100. To find the amt that it is reduced 
         when a hit is taken, find the modified damage:
         Modified Damage = weapon damage / (2*(current shield 
         class)). Shield power is always incremented automatical-
         ly at a rate of 1 per 5 sec so long as its below 100 for 
         any side. Increase energy consumption. "LOWER SHIELDS" -
         Change condition to lowered. If the status display is up
         change it accordingly. Decrease energy consumption.
      b. Arm/Disarm Weapons: If there are no weapons when the 
         button is pressed, give the message "WE DO NOT HAVE ANY
         WEAPONS, CAPTAIN". When the weapons are disarmed, this
         option reads "ARM WEAPONS". When they are armed it reads
         "DISARM". If ship has Missles and Lasers, give message:
         <-- Missles or Lasers -->. If the status display is up,
         change the UNARMED to ARMING (flashing). The process of
         arming takes 6 seconds. When weapons are armed, give the
         message "BUTTON FIRES MISSLES/LASERS". If the user is not
         in maneuver mode, add to the above phase "WHEN MANEUVERING"
         For as long as the weapons are armed, increase the energy
         consumption. When the weapon has finished arming, pressing
         the button causes the weapon to fire if maneuvering. 
         Weapons may not be fired in hyperspace, in a system menu,
         or while orbiting a planet. Every time a weapon is fired
         a certain amt of energy is consumed. Disarming - When 
         this button is pressed weapons disarm immediately.    
         Change the status display to "UNARMED", and remove the
         crosshairs and any weapons text. ( for details on weapons,
         see the document on ship weapons)     
      c. Maneuvering: This button allows the user to control move-
         ment in hyperspace and on the tactical screen with the
         joystick. During maneuvering give the message "ANY KEY
         RETURNS TO COMMAND CONTROL". Hitting any key ends maneuver-
         ing and returns joystick control to console.
      d. Hyperspace: When maneuvering on the sector map there is
         a 16 dot Nav-Ring around the ship icon. (for start up
         conditions in hyperspace upon launch or jump to FTL see
         Engineer / FTL). Movement rate in hyperspace is constant
         at hyper-speed and drop to sublight speed is automatic
         and occurs only when some form of encounter occurs.
         Direction is controlled with left/right movement of the
         joystick. This changes the highlighted dot in the Nav-
         Ring and the ships heading. There are 16 dots and 16
         possible directions. Pressing the button or moving the 
         joystick forward of backward has no effect.
      e. Sublight Space: Pushing the joystick left/right turns the
         ship left of right. Pushing the joystick forward makes the
         ship accelerate forward by firing the rear rockets. Pulling
         the joystick back makes the ship decelerate by firing the
         forward rockets(these are only half as powerful as the 
         rear rockets. Pushing the button fires an armed weapon.
      f. Tactical: The ship is represented by a small multi-
         directional icon (see the Micro-Painter file "SHIPS.TAC"
         on the MVS work disk)

4. ENGINEER:
      a. Damage - Check to see if the damage display is not already 
         up in the Aux screen. If it is, give the message: "THE
         DAMAGED DISPLAY IS ALREADY UP". If not, put it up. (see
         ship damage and repair document for details).
      b. Repair - If the damage display is not already up, put it
         up in the aux screen. Put a cursor over the top item
         (hull) in the damage display. Give the message "USE
         JOYSTICK TO CHANGE SELECTION. PRESS BUTTON TO BEGIN
         REPAIR". For whatever the cursor is on, also give the mes-
         sage "ITEM ____ LEVEL DAMAGE ____ ESTIMATED TIME FOR   
         COMPLETE REPAIR IS ____ HRS". The repairable ship items
         are: hull, engines, sensors, comm equip, shields, missles,
         and lasers. The damage levels are none, minor, moderate
         and heavy. When the button is pressed check to see if the 
         engineer is busy repairing something else, if so give the
         message "STILL REPAIRING THE ____ , CAPTAIN. SHALL I DIS-
         CONTINUE AND WORK ON THIS INSTEAD?  <-- N Y -->" If the 
         answer is no then abort the new repair command. If the 
         answer is yes, or if the engineer was not busy check to
         see if the ship item is damaged. If it is not, give the
         message "NO REPAIRS ARE REQUIRED, CAPTAIN". Otherwise,
         give the message "BEGINNING REPAIRS ON THE ____, CAPTAIN".
         If the item has been completely restored, give the message 
         "REPAIRS ON THE _____ ALL COMPLETED,SIR". (for details on
         repairs see ship damage and repair document).
      c. FTL - When this is pressed, check to see if the ship is at
         sublight speed. If not, give the message - "WE ARE ALREADY
         IN HYPERSPACE, CAPTAIN, YOU DIPSHIT". Otherwise ... give
         the message "CHARGING THE HYPERDRIVES CAPTAIN, STANDBY".
         Now wait for a random amt of time ( 5 to 15 secs). If
         during this time any weapons are fired, give the message
         "DIVERTING POWER TO WEAPONS. JUMP ABORTED" and abort the
         jump. Otherwise ... give the message "JUMPING TO HYPER-
         SPACE". Rapidly accelerate the ship forward w/ whoooosh
         (if it hits anything tough cookies !! Put up the sector
         map. The ship is shown as stationary with a Nav-Ring 
         around it and the message "USE JOYSTICK TO ALTER HEADING,
         PRESS BUTTON TO ENGAGE HYPERDRIVES".
      d. Shuttle - Check to see if the ship is orbiting a planet.
         If not give the message "THE SHUTTLE MAY ONLY BE DEPLOY-
         ED WHEN THE SHIP IS IN ORBIT CAPTAIN, YOU FOOL" If the 
         ship is in orbit give the message "ENTERING THE SHUTTLE.
         WAIT 3 SECS THEN SWITCH TO THE SHUTTLE DISPLAY " (see
         shuttle document for details).
5. COMM OFF: 
      a. Communicate - check to see if there are any objects with-
         in communication range (any ships, planets of bouys). If
         not give the message "THERE IS NOTHING WITHIN COMMUNICAT-
         ION RANGE,CAPTAIN". Otherwise ... communications may be
         established with ships or bouys during an encounter or 
         with a planet during orbit. Communications may not be
         established at the system level. If tried, the message
         "NO 1 IS IN RANGE SIR" is returned. [The communicate 
         option "opens" communications and does not have to be 
         pressed each time a transmission is sent.] The aliens may   
         or may not have already tried to establish communications.
         If they have, the user will have recieved the message "
         CAPTAIN, WE ARE RECIEVING A TRANSMISSION FROM THE ALIEN",
         (object/planet). If this is the case, the first message
         is automatically recieved (provided your ship is in range)
         upon pressing this button. Otherwise give the message
         "OPENING A HAILING FREQUENCY CAPTAIN" Wait 5 seconds. 
         Now ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh

6. DOCTOR: 
      a. Examine - Is the doctor busy? If so give message "I AM
         STILL TREATING A PATIENT, CAPTAIN. SHALL I STOP AND DO
         THIS INSTEAD?". <-- Y N --> response from joystick. If
         no, abort command.  If yes,  give the message "WHO DO YOU 
         WISH TO EXAMINE?", along with the list of crew members.
         Use  the format for item activites (layout #3) with  the 
         message at the bottom. Selecting Quit aborts the examin-
         ation. When a crewmember is chosen, give the results of 
         the examination in the text window. (for details refer
         to the examination and treatment document). 
      b. Treat: Is the doctor busy? If so give the same message
         as above in EXAMINE. Check to see if this character
         requires treatment. If not, give the message "THIS
         CREWMEMBER DOES NOT REQUIRE TREATMENT." If he does,
         check to see if he requires treatment or has already
         undergone treatment and is in the process of healing.
         If so give the message "THIS PATIENT HAS ALREADY BEEN
         TREATED". Treatment adds the amount of vitality it would 
         take to reach 100 at the time the treatment is done, ie.
         the effects of old treatments do not help new wounds.
         The amount of time the treatment takes (meaning the amt
         of time the doctor is busy and the amt of time it takes
         the patient to heal are dependent on the skill of the
         doctor ( see examination and treatment document).
